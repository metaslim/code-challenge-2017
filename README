* Environment

Ruby 2.3

* Tests

Using Rspec. All tests are placed on spec/

rake

or

rake spec

or

rspec

* How to run the app

./bin/survey-tool -s=example-data/survey-2.csv -r=example-data/survey-2-responses.csv

* Design

This app has 3 models (employee, response and question). Employee and question can be created using registry via create class method, so there will be only one instance per id. This will allow the app to look up employee and question by id using Employee.get(id) or Question.get(id)

This app use CSV loader to parse the CSV. However if there is a need to parse non CSV files such as JSON, We can make a new loader by :
 1) Implementing "parse" class method (converting file stream into data source) and extends BaseLoader
 2) Implementing "generate" class method (converting data source to models to be consumed by reports) that consist of a block to be yielded by "parse" class method

 This app has 4 presenters while the code challenges only require 3 presenters (participation percentage, rating average, and total participant). To add a new presenter (please see example single selection), we need to implement "style" method in the new presenter and extends Presenter class who will consume that new "style" method
